                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a cybersecurity student with a passion for coding. My curiosity led me to dive deep into various programming languages and technologies, always with a focus on security. I've soon grown tired of just relying on tools to find vulnerabilities and, as a result, started exploring the code itself. After all, tools are useless if there is nothing built to test against.

                <p>
                    My goal is to create, maintain, and deconstruct projects to develop safer technologies and methodologies in the future. By bridging my knowledge of cybersecurity and software development, I build robust applications that are secure from the ground up.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Here are a few of the projects I've worked on to satisfy my curiosity and deepen my understanding of coding concepts. While some of these are works in progress, each one represents a unique exploration into new technologies and security methodologies.

                    <div class="project-description-box">
                        <p>
                            A self-developed desktop antivirus program used to analyze and defend against malware, with plans for live demonstrations against custom payloads.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of system-level security, detection methods, and mitigation techniques from both an offensive and defensive perspective. Although still a work in progress, this remains one of my favorite projects to revisit in my free time.

                    <h3>Handcrafted 3D Game Engine</h3>
                    <p>
                        A personal project to build a 3D game engine from the ground up, focusing on core programming concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) and game loops. This was also a primary project for me to deepen my understanding and implementation of vector mathematics.

                    <p>
                        I often turn to this project to de-stress and maintain productivity during demanding times like final exams. It serves as a creative outlet while still reinforcing fundamental development skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is still in progress.</p>

                    <p>
                        A weather application built with React that displays daily high and low temperatures for the week. The list is dynamic, always reordering to show the current day at the top. This project is a work in progress and serves as a sandbox for me to experiment with APIs and practice security methods, such as input sanitization on fetched data.

                    <p>
                        I regularly revisit this application to hone my skills and use it as a personal testbed for practicing bug bounties before participating in real-world programs.

                    <h3>Brycecoin</h3>
                    <p>
                        A project to develop a custom cryptocurrency, cloned from the Peercoin blockchain. This was a deep dive into the inner workings of cryptocurrencies, wallets, networking, and blockchain technologies. Although currently non-functional, it provided a valuable learning experience in managing a large codebase and using professional Git and GitHub workflows.

                    <p>
                        This project allowed me to explore complex build systems like Autotools and serves as a long-term experiment. I plan to debug the issues and develop a unique feature where a portion of the mining pool is allocated to a charity or scholarship fund.
